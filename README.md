## Spotify Recreation
### Steps & Procedures

1. Created a new repository
    ### Example
    * Clicked on + icon/drop down
    * Chose new repository
    * I named repository "code-challenge-4"
    * Typed in description
    * Initialized repository by adding a README.md & .gitignore file
    * Clicked on "create repository"


2. Cloned new repository to desktop
   ### Cloning a repository example
   * Click on code (usually highlighted green) on repository page you would like to clone
   * Copy (by clicking clipboard icon) HTTPS or SSH
   * Open iTerm for mac users or Commander for PC users
   * Navigate to proper folder/directory (usually the main folder/directory where one keeps all their projects)
   * Example: in command line type name of main folder/directory> msimbo-class (PC users type> cd msimbo-class) click enter
   * Once in main folder/directory, type> git clone "paste copied HTTPS OR SSH "> click enter
   

3. Created necessary files (One can create files using Webstorm & Visual Studio Code)
   or command line (iTerm for mac users & Commander for PC users)

   ### Webstorm & Visual Studio Code examples
   * Go to menu click on file, from options choose new, then choose what file you would like to create
     or right click with in column, choose new and from options choose file you would like to create

   ### Command line examples (iTerm for mac users & Commander for PC users)
   * touch  index.html  styles.css  app.js  "**case sensitive**"

   ### File examples
   * index.html
   * styles.css
   * app.js


4. In iTerm (commander for PC users) entered commands for dependencies
   ### Example
   * yarn add live-server
   * yarn add tailwindcss
  

5. I created a .gitignore file, which can be created, when starting a new repository on Github. It can also be created using the command line (iTerm for mac users or Commander for PC users) as well as in Webstorm & or Visual Studio Code. The .gitignore file is used to hide files you do not want Github to track, but still can be seen by contributors as well as see what files are hidden/ignored
   ### Creating .gitignore file examples
   * Visual Studio Code and Webstorm
      * File> New> .gitignore
   * iTerm (mac users) & Commander (PC users)
      * touch .gitignore & for PC users> cd touch .gitignore
   * To add files/folders you do not want tracked. Just open .gitignore file in your preffered editor and type the files/folder you do not want tracked. 

6. Ran necessary commands to be able to utilize stylecss tailwindcss within HTML
